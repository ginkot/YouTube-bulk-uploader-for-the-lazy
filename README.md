[About]

YouTube Bulk Uploader for the Lazy allows you to easily BULK UPLOAD and TAG 1000's of videos OFFLINE!

The offline capability is truly unique! If you're on a train, bus, in the office or anywhere with no internet connection but need to tag you're videos, then this application is perfect for you! Simply drag and drop 100's of videos onto the software, edit them in bulk, and add to the upload queue! Once you get an internet connection, hit upload!

When video files are dropped onto the application... a video title, description and set of tags are automatically generated using the video's file name. If you name your video something descriptive, then say goodbye to time consuming video tagging!

All video uploads have resume support, so if you need to leave in a hurry, close the application and on the next run all videos will resume where they left off! Great for large video files! Resume support works on ALL videos, not just to last video which was uploading at the time. This feature is very unique to this application!

You can choose whether to content manage videos with this software. If so, then the software will physically tag each added video file by adding a small property to the physical file. If you rename any of your videos or move them around on your hard drive, simply run the File Path Sync tool and the software will re-locate these videos. Think of it as a very easy to use file management system, but for YouTube videos! The physical tag is a invisible to the user and it doesn't affect the video in any way.

Once a video is added to the software, you can re-edit the video information later using the Video Database tool. Simply locate your video and press edit! All edits to the video will be reflected locally and on your uploaded video if on YouTube!

The software makes use of an internal database to store all video information. This is easily managed and maintained by using the software.

Social Media integration allows for seamless auto-sharing to Facebook. You can auto-share uploaded videos to: Facebook Timelines, Facebook Groups or Facebook Pages.

The Import/Export Video Database utility allows for easy transfer of your videos to and from similar applications.

The in-built Automated YouTube Targeted Keyword Generation Tool allows you to research and use current trending targeted YouTube keywords as your video tags. This gives your video the best chance to be found and viewed. No more tag guessing and no more manual tag research!

SPINTAX integration allows users to generate and spin unique video titles and descriptions.

Wikipedia integration allows users to instantly generate insightful video descriptions from Wikipedia using one click of a button!
